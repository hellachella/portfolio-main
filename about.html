  <p>Heeey.  I'm Chelle. I coded this portfolio by hand.  I really want you to know that. I put HTML,
  CSS, JS, & Jekyll into a bowl and mixed it just like your grandmother does when she makes those
   sweet sweet cinnamon buns (and leaves OUT the raisins because she knows they are disgusting and you hate them).</p>
  <p>I live in Ottawa.  I'm a designer/motion artist/illustrator/plant killer&mdash; <span class="italic">although I do like fresh produce</span>.  Thanks to a plethora of
  local farmers markets, I can have it all. I also like beer and Walker's shortbread and I don't take sugar in my coffee due to an experiment I did
  where I tried to remove sugar from my diet and the only thing that stuck was the taste I developed for strangely creamy bitter coffee.

  </p>
  <p>Dang.  I talked more about foods than design again.
