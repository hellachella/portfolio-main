I'm Chelle Lorenzen, an Ottawa based Graphic Designer and Illustrator. I like being nerdy about concepts, typefaces, typography, kerning, coding, motion graphics, books, music and beer. My work has been seen on the sides of buses (Ottawa International Animation Festival 2016!), in Applied Arts magazine and also on papers scattered under my dining room table.
