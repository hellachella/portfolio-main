            She keeps the look of her natural pores and downy hairs while skin tone is smoothed, and blemishes
            and scars are removed without a fake overbrushed look.

          <p class="push-1-2">
The concept behind the <i>F** Natural Beauty</i>
campaign is split, and forces the viewer to decide if
the ad is saying F*** Natural Beauty, or
<i>F***</i> Natural Beauty.
The Model is wearing neutral, but heavy
makeup. She doesn’t look like this naturally,
and the demographic for this ad
know it. Her skin has been touched up to
near perfect and her pupils dilated to make it feel sexy. She
is looking the viewer directly into the eyes.
This is where the second concept, <i>F***
Natural Beauty</i> becomes evident. The
word f*** is pointing directly at her dialed
pupils for a less than subtle message. Are
they saying to hell with Natural Beauty
(buy our products), or does it mean the
natural look achieved on this model using
the product is seductive?</p>
<p>
This ad caters to an edgier, but still higher income
demographic.  It may not be used on billboards, but one might expect to see
this on direct targeted mail and in less traditional publications and venues.
I have removed the  company logo I had associated with this campaign because this project was
only an exercise and the nature of it is over the top.
