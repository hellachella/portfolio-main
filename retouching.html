            Retouching while maintaining the texture of the model's skin ensures a more natural look.
            She keeps the look of her natural pores and downy hairs while skin tone is smoothed, and blemishes
            and scars are removed without a fake overbrushed look.

            When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, "How are we to get out of the
            forest now?" But Hansel comforted her and said, "Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will
            soon find the way." And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the
            pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way. They walked the whole night long,
            and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened
            it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, "You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the
            forest? We thought you were never coming back at all."
