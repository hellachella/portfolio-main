        </span>his is my final assignment for Motion Graphics I at Algonquin College, and the winner of an Applied Arts Student award,
        to be published in November 2016.
        The assignment was to create a tactile video. I chose to do a Hansel and Gretel television show style opener.
        I thought that it would be interesting to do it from perspective of the witch, who is preparing wicked treats
        for children who might come along. I was lucky enough to be given the use of a friend's farmhouse in Spencerville,
        Ontario where they had just butchered a pig a few days prior. They kept the pigs head for me, so yes, that is a real pig's head.
        The farm is small, and organic, and the home is made of straw, which gave the ambience that I was looking for in a location.
        The video is intended to look disjointed and somewhat off. The frames are cut in a way that leads the viewer's eye from place to place.

      <p class="push-1-2">I was inspired to use this dark style after doing a hand letting project early in the semester where the objective was to make
        handmade type for one of the
        <i>Grimms Fairytales
        </i>.  I chose the macabre story,
        <i>The Robber Bridegroom
        </i> which everyone who is into
        terrifying children's stories should read.  The story is about cannibals and strange birds and child brides, so maybe not at bedtime
        or for actual children. The lettering was done in meat and the other unsavory bits such as the pig tongue and skin were provided by the same
        friends on the same farm the film was shot on. if you click on the photo, you will see my real engagement ring on a pig's tail looking
        like a finger.
      </p>
      <p>I enjoyed doing this tactile project, and wanted to explore the idea further, so when it came time to create a tactile stop motion project, I knew I wanted to
        revisit this theme. What is more tactile than moving meat and candy letters? I was lucky in that my friends had just two days earlier butchered a pig for their personal
        use and still had the head in their freezer. While terribly unsettling, it made a great creepy backdrop for my cannibal witch cottage theme, and was a happy edition. Bitey has now
        been immortalized in digital media.
