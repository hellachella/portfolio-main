        <p>Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the
        wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree
        which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and
        they fell fast asleep. </p>

        <p>When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, "How are we to get out of the
        forest now?" But Hansel comforted her and said, "Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way." And
        when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver
        pieces, and showed them the way. They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They
        knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, "You naughty children, why have you
        slept so long in the forest? We thought you were never coming back at all."</p>
