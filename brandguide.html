            Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the
            strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which
            he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been
            sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, "How are we to get out of the
            forest now?" But Hansel comforted her and said, "Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will
            soon find the way." And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the
            pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way. They walked the whole night long,
            and by break of day came once more to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened
            it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said, "You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the
            forest? We thought you were never coming back at all."
